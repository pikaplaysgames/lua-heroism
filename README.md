# lua-heroism

<!-- NOTE: UPDATE THIS OPENER WITH OTHER DEPENDANCIES AS NEEDED! -->
A full game written in Lua using [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)! This project has been something I've wanted to make for a long time now, and I'm really happy that I finally started. I'm using Lua since it's a fast language that I know and am comfortable using, I'm also generally very productive in Lua.

This is an open-ended role-playing game where the player ...

# Dependancies

If you want to play or contribute to the game, you'll need to make sure you have the dependancies. Of course we rely on Lua 5.4, so you'll definitely need to have it installed.

### Installing Lua for Windows

For installing on Windows, you'll have to go to the <i>LuaBinaries</i> SourceForge page [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.4.2/Tools%20Executables/). From there it should be as simple as extract and install.

### Installing Lua for Linux

You'll want to get your terminal open for these steps. The commands may vary slightly depending on your distribution of choice.

Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install lua5.4`

OpenSUSE: `sudo zypper install lua54`

RHEL/CentOS: `sudo yum install lua`

Fedora: `sudo dnf install lua`

Arch: `sudo pacman -Sy lua`

If there are other commands or package managers I'm missing, please edit this README with them and open a pull request please!

### Installing Lua for MacOS

#### Build from source

TODO: Fill out.

#### Homebrew

In your terminal, make sure `brew` is up to date; `brew update`. Once you've confirmed this, simply type;

`brew install lua`

And it should work its magic.
