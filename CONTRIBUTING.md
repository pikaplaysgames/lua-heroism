## Code of Conduct

There currently is not much in the way of a "code of conduct" as of writing this. But I do have some small, easy to follow rules:

1. Please only use ['camelCase'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Camel_case) when writing function names or variable names.
2. Comment your code, it's always good to have a human written explanation of a function.
3. Please comment your code in English. If English is not your mother tongue, translations are accepted.

If you have any other questions, feel free to open an issue and we can start discussion!
